## Static Websites

Static websites are sites that don't use dynamic content. These are webpages which are hard coded in basic HTML.

## Difference from Dynamic Websites

Dynamic sites are served on the fly according to the clients request. A client would get a page in accordance to his request. Whereas, a static site can be thought of as a constant page which doesn't change.

## Why use Static Websites

Static websites serve different purposes. It is code-wise minimal and don't use many hectic features of the dynamic websites. Static websites don't residue in a database, thus making it much secure in case of a database breach. Not having a database system means you don't have to worry about many security details. SQL injection and XSS attacks can't be presented in these sites.

Also, CMS based websites can be very cumbersome sometimes as not every feature of the CMS is needed for every website. It's hectic to work your way to find out which services you don't need, which you do, if not present how to set up a specific feature etcetera etc...

Whereas, the goal of a static site is to provide the features you need in your site according to your necessity.

## Static Site Generators
